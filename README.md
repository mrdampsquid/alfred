This is a python based Alfred flow. 

This workflow probes for open TCP ports, it reveals if the port you specify is open or closed. If open, it reports latency.
If, instead of a port number a dash '-' is given, the workflow will check ports 22, 80 and 443, reporting latency for each open one.

Format is keyword 'pp' followed by host\<space\>port 

where:

* host is hostname or IP address,
* port is a numerical value or -
